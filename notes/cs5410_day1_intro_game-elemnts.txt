Game Components & Architecture
    Game Theory:
        - Multi-agents maximize gains within framework of well-defined set of game rules
    Game Dev:
        - Games are software, thus game development is software development
    What is a Game Engine?
        Whatever is used in common between multiple games
            - Physics Engines
            - Graphics Engines
            - etc.
        Started in mid 1990's with Doom
        Key Goal:
            - Eliminate hard-coded games that can't be re-used to make other games

Javascript 101:
    - Really called "ECMA Script"
        - i.e. ES5, ES6
        - Javascript is an implementation of ECMA Script standard
    Function Scope:
        - Not scoped to braces, but the life-time a function in which a variable is defined
        - NOT originally block scoped
        - Variables:
            - Function scope -> var
            - Block scope -> let # USE THIS!!!


EXAMPLE Program:

let message = 'THIS IS A MESSAGE';
console.log(message); # sends message to log in the console inside the browser
