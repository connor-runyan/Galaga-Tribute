Game Camera Mistakes:
    - 3 styles:
        - Fixed angle third person
        - Dynamic third person
        - First person

    Issues:
        1 - Using a dynamic camera whena nother approach would work
            - recommends fixed angle and first person
        2 - designing levels and camera behaviors that don't match
        3 - Using global coordinates to persist the gamera state
            - base it on avatar placement
            - use Euler angles
        4 - Using camera distance likely to break line-of-sight
        5 - ALlowing obstacles to break line-of-sight from side
        6 - Pushing away from an obstacle while player is tring to swing towards it
        7 - Letting player push the camera inside an obstacle
        8 - Letting independent forces compete to push the camera
        9 - Keeping narrow columns from breaking line-of-sight
        10 - Letting camera intersect narrow columns
        11 - Interpreting a hill as a wall to be avoided
        12 - Swinging sideways when occluders come from behind
        13 - Letting camera's near clipping plane interesect the avatar
        14 - Use the same camera distance for all angles
        15 - using same fov for worm's eye view
        16 - shiting pitch, dtsnace, and fov independently
        17 - not cutting when the avatar passes through opaque areas
        18 - letting cuts remap direction control
        19 - breaking player's sense of direction
        20 - viloating the 180 degree rules
            - Don't rotate camera so much that character swaps
        21 - focusing only on the avatar
        22 - leaving camera movement soley to the player
        23 - leaving camera yaw alone as player is running
        24 - making it hard to judge distances
        25 - looking straight ahead as the avatar approaches a cliff
        26 - keeping camera level when the avatar is running on a slope
        27 - misusing the rule of thirds
        28 - using same logic for ground and air motion
        29 - relying entirely on procedural camera behaviors
        30 - letting players make themselves lost and confused
